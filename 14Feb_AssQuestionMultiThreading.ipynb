    "- ANS --> Multithreading in Python refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple threads (smaller units of a process) concurrently within the same process. Each thread runs independently, performing its designated tasks. Multithreading is used to achieve concurrent execution, allowing a program to make better use of available resources and potentially improve performance for certain types of tasks.\n",
